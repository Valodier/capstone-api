Want to be able to assign a task to a person.
Requires a groupid and automatically incrementing integer for each group, ideally on large enough scale this would be similiar to a jwt? Like a unique id with letters and numbers so random people cant add themselves to groups

This would get mined so hard for the data. God, selling cleaning producs? Furniture? Ads galore on something like this.
